<p><strong> This workshop is in conjunction with <a href="https://asplos-conference.org/">ASPLOS 2021</a> </strong>
&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong> Friday, April 16, 2021 | Full Day</strong></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to the Workshop on Robustness and Safe Software 2.0 (RSS2). 
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike Software 1.0 (conventional programs) that is manually coded with hardened parameters and explicit logics, Software 2.0 programs, usually manifested as and enabled by Deep Neural Networks (DNN), have learnt parameters and implicit logics. Software 2.0 is found in a diverse set of applications in today’s society, ranging from autonomous machines, Augmented/Virtual Reality devices, to smart-city infrastructures.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the systems and architecture communities have focused, rightly so, on the efficiency of DNNs, Software 2.0 exposes a unique set of challenges for robustness, safety, and resiliency, which are major roadblocks before Software 2.0 becomes a pervasive computing paradigm. For instance, small perturbations to inputs could easily “fool” DNNs to produce incorrect results, giving rise to the so-called adversarial attacks. Similarly, while DNNs are generally resilient to hardware faults, few have studied the worst-case resiliency of DNNs to hardware faults, which usually dictated the safety of mission-critical systems.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Improving the robustness, safety, and resiliency of Software 2.0 is necessarily a cross-layer task, just like how algorithms, programming language, architecture, and circuits communities came together in the Software 1.0 era. It is also critical to not hyper-optimize individual system components; rather, we must take a whole-of-system approach that understands the requirements and constraints of end-to-end systems, which are usually multi-chip and span both client, edge, and cloud.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>To that end, the workshop is meant to foster an interactive discussion about computer systems and architecture research’s role of robust, safe, and resilient Software 2.0. Ultimately, the workshop is meant to lead to new discussions and insights on algorithms, architectures, and circuit/device-level design as well as system-level integration and co-design.</p>

<h4 id="talk-1-towards-secure-and-robust-autonomy-software-in-autonomous-driving">Talk 1: Towards Secure and Robust Autonomy Software in Autonomous Driving</h4>
<p><span id = "jump1"></span></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Autonomous Driving (AD) technology has always been an international pursuit due to its significant benefit in driving safety, efficiency, and mobility. Over 15 years after the first DARPA Grand Challenge, its development and deployment are becoming increasingly mature and practical, with some AD vehicles already providing services on public roads (e.g., Google Waymo One in Phoenix and Baidu Apollo Go in China). In AD technology, the autonomy software stack, or the AD software, is highly security critical: it is in charge of safety-critical driving decisions such as collision avoidance and lane keeping, and thus any security problems in it can directly impact road safety. In this talk, I will describe my recent research that initiates the first systematic effort towards understanding and addressing the security problems in production AD software. I will be focusing on two critical modules: perception and localization, and talk about how we are able to discover novel and practical sensor/physical-world attacks that can cause end-to-end safety impacts such as crashing into obstacles or driving off road. Besides AD software, I will also briefly talk about my recent research on autonomy software security in smart transportation in general, especially those enabled by Connected Vehicle (CV) technology. I will conclude with a discussion on defense and future research directions.</p>

<p><span id = "jump2"></span></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> It has become clear that deep neural networks (DNNs) have an immense potential to learn and perform complex tasks. It is also evident that DNNs have many vulnerabilities with the potential to render them useless in complex and extended operating environments. The purpose of our research is to investigate ways in which DNN models are vulnerable to “adversarial attacks,” while also leveraging such adversarial techniques to construct more robust and reliable deep learning-based systems. We explore the potential weaknesses of DNN models by developing advancedfeature space-based adversarial attacks, which create adversarial directions that are generally effective for data distribution. The learned distributions can also be used to analyze layer-wise and model-wise transfer properties and gain insights into how feature distributions evolve with layer depth and architecture. Alternatively, we investigate the ensemble methods against transfer attacks. Our approach (namely, DVERGE) isolates the adversarial vulnerability in each sub-model by distilling non-robust features. It then diversifies the adversarial vulnerability to induce diverse outputs against a transfer attack. New challenges for developing robust DNN models will be discussed at the end of the talk.</p>

<h4 id="talk-3-explainable-ml-challenges-and-opportunities">Talk 3: Explainable ML: Challenges and Opportunities</h4>
<p><span id = "jump7"></span></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> As machine learning is increasingly being deployed in real world applications, it has become critical to ensure that stakeholders understand and trust these models. End users must have a clear understanding of the model behavior so they can diagnose errors and potential biases in these models, and decide when and how to employ them. However, most accurate models that are deployed in practice are not interpretable, making it difficult for users to understand where the predictions are coming from, and thus, difficult to trust. Recent work on explanation techniques in machine learning offers an attractive solution: they provide intuitive explanations for “any” machine learning model by approximating complex machine learning models with simpler ones. In this talk, I will discuss several popular post hoc explanation methods, and shed light on their advantages and shortcomings. I will conclude the tutorial by highlighting open research problems in the field.</p>

<h4 id="talk-4-resilient-deep-learning-accelerators">Talk 4: Resilient Deep Learning Accelerators</h4>
<p><span id = "jump3"></span></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Resilience to hardware failures is a key challenge as well as a top priority for deep learning (DL) accelerators, which have been deployed in a wide range of application domains, from edge computing, self-driving cars, to cloud servers. DL accelerates are susceptible to various hardware failure sources, including temporary/transient errors (such as soft errors and dynamic variations) and permanent failures (such as early-life failures, circuit aging, and manufacturing defect escapes). Although DL workloads exhibit certain tolerance to errors, such tolerance alone cannot guarantee that a DL accelerator will meet the resilience requirement of a target application in the presence of hardware errors. In this talk, I will first present a resilience analysis framework, which takes advantage of the architectural properties of DL accelerators to accurately and quickly analyze the behavior of hardware errors in these accelerators. Next, using this framework, we perform a large-scale resilience study to thoroughly understand the resilience properties of DL accelerators/workloads. The key findings of this study will be discussed. Finally, I will share our insights on how to design resilient DL accelerators.</p>

<p><span id = "jump8"></span></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Hardware has a crucial role in both ML and security. On the one hand, recent advances in Deep Learning (DL) fueled by platform capabilities have enabled a paradigm shift to include machine intelligence in a wide range of autonomous tasks. As a result, a largely unexplored surface has opened up for attacks jeopardizing the integrity of DL models and hindering their ubiquitous deployment across various intelligent applications. On the other hand, DL-based algorithms are also being employed for identifying several security vulnerabilities on long streams of multi-modal data and logs, including hardware logs. In this talk, I will discuss how end-to-end automated frameworks based on algorithm/hardware co-design help with both (1) realizing accelerated low-
overhead shields against DL attacks, and (2) enabling low overhead and real-time intelligent security monitoring.</p>

<h4 id="talk-6-rethinking-computing-with-neuro-inspired-learning-devices-circuits-and-systems">Talk 6: Rethinking Computing with Neuro-Inspired Learning: Devices, Circuits, and Systems</h4>
<p><span id = "jump4"></span></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Advances in machine learning, notably deep learning, have led to computers matching or surpassing human performance in several cognitive tasks including vision, speech and natural language processing. However, implementation of such neural algorithms in conventional "von-Neumann" architectures are several orders of magnitude more area and power expensive than the biological brain. Hence, we need fundamentally new approaches to sustain exponential growth in performance at high energy-efficiency beyond the end of the CMOS roadmap in the era of ‘data deluge’ and emergent data-centric applications. Exploring the new paradigm of computing necessitates a multi-disciplinary approach: exploration of new learning algorithms inspired from neuroscientific principles, developing network architectures best suited for such algorithms, new hardware techniques to achieve orders of improvement in energy consumption, and nanoscale devices that can closely mimic the neuronal and synaptic operations of the brain leading to a better match between the hardware substrate and the model of computation. In this talk, I will focus on our recent works on neuromorphic computing with spike based learning and the design of underlying hardware that can lead to quantum improvements in energy efficiency with good accuracy.</p>

<h4 id="talk-7-coupled-oscillators-based-few-shot-unsupervised-learning">Talk 7: Coupled Oscillators Based Few Shot Unsupervised Learning</h4>
<p><span id = "jump5"></span></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Today’s machine learning (ML) algorithms operate by constructing a model with parameters that are learned from a large input dataset such that the trained model can then make predictions about similar data. In this domain of narrow AI, much of the success comes from deterministic ML models such as feed-forward neural networks where the globally calculated error is backpropagated through multiple layers for synaptic weight update. This requires repeated trial and error process which is problematic for real-world applications such as learning from noisy data or infer latent correlations within data. Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) are useful generative energy-based models with applications ranging across pattern analysis and generation. However, unsupervised training of RBM involves computationally demanding gradient calculations or sampling-based approximations with large sample sizes. In this talk, we will explore a novel pathway to reducing the sampling cost by implementing a physical compute fabric of coupled oscillators whose natural dynamics correspond to drawing uncorrelated samples from a desired RBM distribution. Leveraging the continuous-time dynamics markedly improves training speed and stability, along with faster converged relative entropy (KL divergence) compared to conventional discrete-time Gibbs sampling.</p>

<h4 id="talk-8-challenges-and-opportunities-of-deep-neural-network-training-or-inferencing-with-synaptic-devices">Talk 8: Challenges and Opportunities of Deep Neural Network Training or Inferencing with Synaptic Devices</h4>
<p><span id = "jump6"></span></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Hardware acceleration of deep neural networks drives new research and development of emerging memory devices to function as synaptic weight elements. Despite the recent progresses in synaptic devices, challenges arise due to the non-ideal effects such as asymmetry and nonlinearity in the conductance tuning, device-to-device variations and cycle-to-cycle variations, which may degrade the training accuracy. Analog-to-digital converter's limited precision and offset as well as the conductance drift may also introduce the inference accuracy loss. On the other hand, these non-ideal effects may also bring opportunities as a countermeasure mechanism for security vulnerabilities such as model reverse engineering and adversarial attack. In this talk, we will present a software-hardware co-evaluation approach to evaluate the impact of non-ideal device properties on the algorithm-level performance.  </p>
