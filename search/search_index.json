Unlike Software 1.0 (conventional programs) that is manually coded with hardened parameters and explicit logics, Software 2.0 programs, usually manifested as and enabled by Deep Neural Networks (DNN), have learnt parameters and implicit logics. Software 2.0 is found in a diverse set of applications in today\u2019s society, ranging from autonomous machines, Augmented/Virtual Reality devices, to smart-city infrastructures. While the systems and architecture communities have focused, rightly so, on the efficiency of DNNs, Software 2.0 exposes a unique set of challenges for robustness, safety, and resiliency, which are major roadblocks before Software 2.0 becomes a pervasive computing paradigm. For instance, small perturbations to inputs could easily \u201cfool\u201d DNNs to produce incorrect results, giving rise to the so-called adversarial attacks. Similarly, while DNNs are generally resilient to hardware faults, few have studied the worst-case resiliency of DNNs to hardware faults, which usually dictated the safety of mission-critical systems. Improving the robustness, safety, and resiliency of Software 2.0 is necessarily a cross-layer task, just like how algorithms, programming language, architecture, and circuits communities came together in the Software 1.0 era. It is also critical to not hyper-optimize individual system components; rather, we must take a whole-of-system approach that understands the requirements and constraints of end-to-end systems, which are usually multi-chip and span both client, edge, and cloud. To that end, the workshop is meant to foster an interactive discussion about computer systems and architecture research\u2019s role of robust, safe, and resilient Software 2.0. Ultimately, the workshop is meant to lead to new discussions and insights on algorithms, architectures, and circuit/device-level design as well as system-level integration and co-design.
